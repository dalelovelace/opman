      Hosts can be configured through two methods, or both.
      If your hosts are named host01.domain host02.domain
      host03.domain etc. you may use the list style configuration
      by assigning a prefix, suffix, number of significant digits,
      and the range of hosts.

      if your hosts do not fit this method, you may also define
      every host individually as the below host="something"
      lines. You may use either, or both modes.

      The example below will be expanded to:

      prefix01.example.com
      prefix02.example.com
      prefix03.example.com
      prefix04.example.com
      prefix06.example.com
      someotherhost03.example.com
      yetanotherhost.anotherdomain.com
    */

    <hosts>
      <list>
        prefix      = "prefix"
        suffix      = ".example.com"
        significant = 2
        digits      = 1-4,6
      </list>
      someotherhost03.example.com
      yetanotherhost.anotherdomain.com
    </hosts>

    /*
      Next you define the actions that may be taken on the hosts 
      that make up this application pool. There are two ways to define 
      actions and either or both may be used in each pool.

      In a simple list contained in a <action> </action> block 
      anything on the left side becomes a target for the -a|--action 
      command line option, and the right side will be executed on 
      the target host when this target for -a|--action is called. 

      Actions that need to change defaults must be contained in their
      own <action ACTIONNAME> </action ACTIONNAME> block. The tag
      "command = COMMAND" is required, however any or all of
      of concurrent =, user = , and timeout = may be specified.

      <action ACTIONNAME> blocks may also contain target = 
      specifying a hostname to execute -a|--action on rather than
      executing on each machine in the pool - action macros are handy here
        * Note that this hostname _can_ be "localhost"

      You can use the following macros in your actions:

      %{HOST} - the hostname of each machine in the pool
      %{ME} - the username you ran opman as
      %{USER} - the user specified by -u|--user

      There are no limits to the things you can add to the <action> section.
